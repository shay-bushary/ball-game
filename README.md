# TwoSteps React task

## (v.1.0.1)

Welcome!

Included with this file is a very simple client-side app.
Your mission, is to improve it a bit by implementing some additional features.
Please focus on good coding practices.
You are not expected to need additional dependencies.

Once done, please send back the new and improved version.

What to do:

1. Make sure that the piece _never_ gets off the screen when moved
2. Add a 'Reset' button that returns the piece back to its initial location
3. Add a 'Randomize' button that places the piece at a random location on the screen
4. When the page loads, get today's temperature from an API and set the piece's color according to the following ranges:

   - Less than 10 degrees: Blue
   - Between 10 and 20 degrees: Green
   - Between 20 and 30 degrees: Yellow
   - More than 30 degrees: Red

   You can use this URL to retrieve the weather data for Tel-Aviv:

5. Make the piece "hollow" when the mouse hovers over it (hollow means only the border should be drawn with the color of the piece)

6. Make the motion of the piece smooth instead of jumpy

Thanks and good luck!
